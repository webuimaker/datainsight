					<p>Our group is made up of patients with a skin disease so rare we often have to doctor ourselves with the information shared online. Our mailing list is truly a lifeline. Because it was so important to us, I made extensive comparisons but one does not know about service until the "honeymoon" period is over. Well, it has been 14 years since we started and I could not be more pleased. Mark guided us through the set-up quickly and painlessly and he's quick to help during the occasional snafu. I can therefore heartily endorse Mail-List.com.</p>
